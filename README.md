# Hello-World
Hello, World. CS members first EVER Github repos. Ever heard of hazing? well this is it..

Welcome to the IEEE: Computer Society!

Here is the workshop guide! Be sure to READ the documentation!

## Step 1: Install Git
First, you need to install Git on your computer. You can download it from the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads). 

## Step 2: Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Then, run the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Computer-Society-EWU/Hello-World.git
```
This will create a local copy of the project on your machine.

## Step 3: Create a New Branch
Navigate into the cloned repository:
```bash
cd Hello-World
```
Then, create a new branch using the `git checkout` command:
```bash
git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
```
Remember to replace `your-new-branch-name` with a name that's relevant to your contribution.

## Step 4: Create Your 'Hello, World' Program
Create a new file in the programming language of your choice that prints "Hello, World". For example, if you're using Python, you could create a file called `hello_world.py` with the following content:
```python
print("Hello, World")
```
Save this file in the `Hello-World` directory.

## Step 5: Commit Your Changes
Add the changes to your branch using the `git add` command:
```bash
git add .
```
Then, commit your changes using the `git commit` command:
```bash
git commit -m "Your meaningful commit message"
```
Remember to replace `Your meaningful commit message` with a message that describes the changes you made.

## Step 6: Push Your Changes to GitHub
Finally, push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub using the `git push` command:
```bash
git push origin your-new-branch-name
```
Remember to replace `your-new-branch-name` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

## Step 7: Create a Pull Request
Go to the [GitHub page](https://github.com/Computer-Society-EWU/Hello-World) of the repository, switch to your branch, and click on the 'Pull Request' button. Fill in the necessary details and submit your pull request.

And that's it! You've just made your first contribution to a GitHub project! ðŸŽ‰
