**Step 8: Merge Your Changes**

After your pull request has been reviewed and approved, you can merge your changes into the main branch. Here's how you do it¹²:

1. Switch to the main branch:
```bash
git checkout main
```
2. Pull the latest updates from the main branch:
```bash
git pull origin main
```
3. Merge your branch into the main branch:
```bash
git merge your-new-branch-name
```
4. Push your changes to the main branch:
```bash
git push origin main
```

**Step 9: Switch Branches**

You can switch between branches using the `checkout` command¹. For example, to switch to another branch:
```bash
git checkout another-branch-name
```

**Step 10: Advanced Git Features**

There are many other advanced Git features you can explore, such as rebasing, cherry-picking, and handling merge conflicts¹². Be sure to read the Git documentation or other online resources to learn more about these features.

Remember to replace `your-new-branch-name` and `another-branch-name` with the actual names of your branches. Happy coding!
